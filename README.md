# Tic Tac Toe

## Description

This is a basic Tic Tac Toe game create in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The JavaScript makes use of `ES6 Modules` instead of CommonJS for a more modern approach. It implements Webpack to build the application for deployment as well as to server the application with hot loading in development.

It makes use of `Node.js v16.20.2`, `webpack@5 (+ supporting packages)` and `pnpm@8` for development, `vitest@0.34.6` for unit-tests and `playwright@1.43.1` for end-to-end tests.

Include in the repository is a `.nvmrc` with the required Node.js version, a `package.json` file with the required packages and a `pnpm-lock.yaml` instead of a package-lock.json as we are using `pnpm`.

There are no CSS Frameworks or Frontend JavaScript Frameworks implemented.

## Configuration

#### Webkit
Webkit is configure to by default produce a production build when the build command is run, this can be changed by updating`mode: production` to `mode: development` in the `webpack.config.js` file.

The build is generated by bundling all the javascript into a `bundle.js` file that is then injected into the end of the `body` tag in the index.html file. It also injects all the CSS and the favicon into the index.html on build.

This is all configured in the `webpack.config.js` file and can be adjust as need be. There is no need to reference any links, styles or scripts directly in the index.html file as webpack uses it as a template and inject all the needed dependencies on build time.

The webpack dev server does the same with the notable differnce that it offers hot loading and doesn't do a production build i.e. the files aren't minified.

#### Vitest

Vitest uses a mostly default configuration which allows for access to globals such as `document` and implements `jsdom` as the environment if any direct dom minipulation needs to be tested.

There isn't a directory specified that contains the vitest test, the command specified under the `Unit Tess` section directly references the file to be run. If there is need to add any more test files, the `vitest.config.js` file can be adapted.

#### Playwright

Playwright in configured to run in `headless` mode by default. There are 3 projects defined in the `playwright.config.js` file to run the tests in either `Chromium`,`Firefox`, or `Webkit` browser engines.

In development mode the output of the test are written to the console in a list format. In the Github Actions CI pipline it is configured to output a HTML file for each browser with the results and store it in an artifact.

## Installation

#### Dependencies that should be preinstalled.
```
NVM (Node Version Manager)
Node v16.20.2
```

This project uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/). Go check them out if you don't have them locally installed.

```bash
$ npm install -g pnpm@8
$ pnpm install
```

## Usage

```bash
$ pnpm start
```

This will start the webpack dev server at `localhost:8080`.

## Build

```bash
$ pnpm run build
```

This will create a production-ready `index.html` and `bundle.js` in the `dist` directory.

## Testing

#### Unit tests (vitest)

```bash
$ pnpm test:vi:run
```

This will run the vitest unit tests.

#### End to end testing (Playwright)
You first need to install the Playwright browsers and dependencies before you can run the tests.
```bash
$ pnpm test:pw:ci
```

Then you need to build the project.
```bash
$ pnpm run build
```

If these steps have completed you can now run the tests.
```bash
$ pnpm test:pw:run:all #This will run the tests in headless mode for chromium, firefox, and webkit
$ pnpm test:pw:run:chromium #This will run the tests in headless mode for just chromium.
$ pnpm test:pw:run:firefox #This will run the tests in headless mode for just firefox.
$ pnpm test:pw:run:webkit #This will run the tests in headless mode for just webkit.
```
If there is a need to see the test running in headed mode you can add the `--headed` flag.
